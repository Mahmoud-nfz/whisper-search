So here we have daily prices and daily simple returns. So these are the simple returns and now we can create additional column log returns and and we can calculate daily returns with the following code. So we have np.log and then we have here the price divided by the previous price. So here on the right hand side we now have the log returns and if you compare simple returns and log returns we can see that they have the same order of magnitude but they're still there different and finance and investment even small differences do matter and we can even better see the differences with aggregated numbers. So let's get some summary statistics with the describe and then here we have the daily mean return, the arithmetic mean and this is a lot different here. So for simple returns we have a mean of 0.116% and for the log returns we have 0.10%. So with regard to the arithmetic mean or the average there is a significant difference between simple returns and log returns. However the risk is the same or more or less the same. So there's actually no real difference here and finally we can also calculate the mean log return explicitly with the mean method. So that's the new here and then we can also calculate the risk or the volatility based on log returns with the SDD method and in the next lecture we'll cover more differences between simple returns and log returns and in particular I will show you the benefits or the advantages of log returns. Thanks for watching and see you there. Bye."
